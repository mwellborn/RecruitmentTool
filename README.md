# Recruitment Tool

Thank you for completing our recruitment tool! This tool helps us gauge your level of expertise. Don't worry if you are unable to complete any of the tasks outlined below, instead be sure to document the steps you followed to help us understand how we can help you to learn. If you get stuck and need help to move on, contact us, we’ll help you through that question so you can move on and respond to the rest. At the end of the process compress the repository files and e-mail them to us, do not commit to this repository.

This tool utilizes .Net. Maybe you’re more familiar with another language, that’s ok, we still think you can figure this out. You can use Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, run from the command line, whatever works best for you, just tell us what you did so we can understand your development process. Feel free to give us feedback when you return your results, we're always trying to get better.

Please complete the following steps and answer the corresponding questions:

1. Clone this repository. Document the steps that you took (commands, tool used, whatever).
2. Open the solution (VS) or folder (VS Code, et. al.). Run the “RecruitmentTool” project. It should run, if not you may need to restore one or more references. Hit one of the endpoints. How did you know what Url to enter? How did you test the endpoint? What happened?
3. Spoiler alert… you found a bug. Find it, and fix it. Document what the bug was and how you fixed it.
4. Now run the solution. What Urls did you hit? What were the results? Did you get what you expected after you reviewed the code? If not, why not?
5. Run the Unit Tests. Bummer, there's a failing Unit Test. Fix it. What was it? How did you fix it? Why are there no Unit Tests for the repository?
6. Add a new endpoint to return the movies that are rated PG. Send it to us, we’d like to see your solution.
